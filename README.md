##Front-End Web Development

Welcome to General Assembly Boston's Front End Web Development!

For instructions on how to join this repo, please ask your instructors on SLACK.

__If you are not on the fewd-bos-18 slack channel please speak to your teacher in class.__

##Planning ahead

Take a look at our schedule, if you can't make a class please notify your GA instructor team so that they can help you make up any loss time.  This can be done through messaging them directly on Slack.  For any upcoming absences, be sure to post to the #attendance channel of what days you will be missing class.  Please be aware, there are a limited number of classes you can miss + still be considered a successful graduate of the program!

##Homework

Please create your own repo for each assignment.  All starter code and instructions will be here for reference and also shared in slack.  Submit your homework by posting the link to your repo to the appropriate weekly homework slack channel.  Homework  grades and feedback will be in the comments of your private homework repo.

##Slides

We will be adding slides and any class material after each class for you to review.


##Questions?

If you have any questions please ask on SLACK or in class :)
